    <h1> Welcome to Jackie's Programming Portfolio Website </h1>
    
    <p> My name is Jackie Morley. This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC 106 Computer Programming course at The University of Rhode Island.
        I wrote this webpage itself using the HTML programming language.
        The Apps link above has apps I have written that run on phones.
        The Javascripts link above has Javascripts I have written to be embedded in webpages. </p>
