<h1> All About Me! </h1>
        
<p> Hello! My name is Jacqueline Morley and this is my programming portfolio page. I am currently a freshman at the University of Rhode Island and
    am majoring in Environmental Economics with a possible minor in computer science. I am from North Kingstown, Rhode Island and have lived there
    my whole life. I hope to one day work for a environmentally-conscious company that instills green intiatives. Below are two pictures of me and
    two of my interests. The ocean picture represents my passion for the ocean and the organisms within it and the recycling symbol represents my 
    passion for sustainable fashion and thrifiting. I hope you enjoy my website! </p>
