    <p> For our CSC 106 final project, my partner and I programmed a game that can be played by a single user. Our program is based on the game</p>
    <p> Snake, but has a few different features and we used the Khan Javascript + ProcessingJS programming environment. When opening the game,</p>
    <p> the user will first see the introduction scene which displays the name of the game, the instructions on how to play, our bitmojis, and</p>
    <p> two difficulty options: easy and hard. We used the Khan button class to create these buttons.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> To play, the user uses the arrow keys on their keyboard to move the circle. As the circle eats the diferent objects, it will grow in size</p>
    <p> If the circle hits the sides, the game will end and the user must restart. If the user eats 20 different objects while not hitting the</p>
    <p>sides, they win. In the easy level, the food moves slowly across the screen and in the hard level the food moves significantly faster.</p>
    <p>It becomes more difficult to eat the food moving fast and to keep the circle in bounds as it grows.</p>
